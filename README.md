# Q&A Chatbot using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

## Overview
This Python script implements a simple question-answering (Q&A) chatbot using the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity. The chatbot is designed to answer user questions based on a provided Q&A dataset.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- nltk
- scikit-learn

You can install them using:
```bash
pip install nltk scikit-learn
```

## Dataset
Replace the placeholder 'your_dataset.txt' in the code with the actual path to your Q&A dataset text file. The dataset should be structured with questions and answers separated by a colon on each line.

Example dataset format:
```
What is the capital of France?:Paris
Who is the president of the United States?:Joe Biden
...

## How to Run
1. Run the script: `python your_script_name.py`
2. Enter a question when prompted.
3. The chatbot will provide the most relevant answer based on the TF-IDF vectorizer and cosine similarity.

## Exiting
Type 'exit' when prompted for a question to end the program.

## Additional Notes
- Make sure your Q&A dataset is appropriately formatted and covers a diverse range of questions.
- Feel free to customize the script based on your specific requirements or add more advanced natural language processing techniques.
